# IAC Project FRDM K64F code
This is the code for our energy project from the IAC (Indiana University's Industrial Audit Commission).

## Building
You need to install the mbed cli to be able to compile and run this embedded program. Documentation for the mbed cli can be found here: [https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v5.12/tools/installation-and-setup.html](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v5.12/tools/installation-and-setup.html)

You can import this repository by using the CLI command: `mbed import https://github.iu.edu/aklapatc/IAC-Project`

That will automatically grab the project and basically `git clone` it right in your current directory.
