# TODO
- change the API so that it is OO, with the board being the Object
- integrate the wifi api into the board object 
- integrate the offline logging into the board object
- add logging for almost every action that the board takes 
- write a test suite
- Remove the Scanning for the Access point, since it seems to cause a buffer overflow
